# Random Password Generator

## Description

The purpose of this exercise was to practice Javascript fundamentals by creating a random password generator. This password generator requires many Javascript basics, including variables, strings, loops, operators, functions, events, and more. This password generator is meant to create a random secure password based on criteria given via prompt boxes. These criteria include character length as well as use of numbers, uppercase letters, and special characters. 

## Installation

At present, this project requires lots of work to be fully deployed. I struggled with many things, most namely getting the prompt boxes to appear when I opened the page. I think that lots of practice with functions is required, because I found myself overwhelmed when trying to keep up with the variables while writing functions. Despite the roadblocks I encountered, I feel much better oriented to Javascript. This assignment has motivated me to reach out for help and catch up a bit.

## Navigation

To navigate this application, enter your criteria into the prompt boxes and press the "Generate Password" button. A random password that meets your criteria should appear.
